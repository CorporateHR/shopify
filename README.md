# Shopify Store Integration

## Credential Configuration

### 1. Obtain Shopify Credentials
- Log in to your [Shopify Partner Dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com/)
- Navigate to your App or create a new App
- Retrieve the following credentials:
  - Shop Domain
  - Access Token
  - API Key
  - API Secret

### 2. Configure Credentials
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Credential Management
- Use environment variables for sensitive information
- Never commit real credentials to version control
- Consider using a secure secret management service in production

### Credential Validation
The application includes a built-in credential validation mechanism in `lib/shopify-config.js`

## Security Best Practices
- Rotate credentials periodically
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Implement proper access controls

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter credential-related errors:
- Verify all environment variables are correctly set
- Check Shopify Partner Dashboard for up-to-date credentials
- Ensure proper scopes are configured
